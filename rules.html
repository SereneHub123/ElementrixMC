        <h1 class="rules">Elementrix – Official Rules</h1>

<p class="rules_welcome">Welcome to Elementrix! These rules are designed to ensure a fair, enjoyable, and respectful environment for all players. By joining and playing on the Elementrix Minecraft Server, you automatically agree to follow the rules listed below. 
                        Failure to comply may result in warnings, mutes, kicks, temporary bans, or permanent bans depending on severity.</p>

<pre>1. General Conduct

1.1 Respect All Players
Treat all players with respect. Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, racism, sexism, threats, or targeted abuse are strictly prohibited.

1.2 No Excessive Toxicity
Friendly trash talk is allowed, but excessive toxicity, bullying, or intentionally provoking others is not.

1.3 Appropriate Language
Excessive swearing, sexual content, or inappropriate discussion in public chat is not allowed. Keep the server friendly and welcoming.

1.4 Staff Respect
Staff decisions must be respected. Arguing in public chat, ignoring staff instructions, or impersonating staff members is prohibited.

2. Chat Rules

2.1 No Spamming or Flooding
Do not spam messages, emojis, commands, or repeated characters.

2.2 No Advertising
Advertising other servers, Discords, YouTube channels, or services without staff permission is not allowed.

2.3 No Scamming or Lying for Gain
Attempting to deceive players for items, currency, or advantages is strictly prohibited.

2.4 Use the Correct Chat Channels
Keep discussions relevant to the channel or purpose (e.g., trade-related chat for trading).

3. Gameplay Rules
3.1 Griefing & Raiding

Griefing is ALLOWED on Elementrix. Players are responsible for protecting their own builds.

Raiding bases, breaking structures, and stealing items is permitted unless otherwise stated for specific events or protected areas.

Complaints about griefing or raiding will generally not result in rollbacks.

⚠️ However: Griefing purely to lag the server, target harassment, or abuse game mechanics (see Section 4) is not allowed.

3.2 PvP (Player vs Player)

PvP is allowed unless you are in a protected or PvP-disabled zone.

Spawn killing or repeatedly targeting the same player to harass them is not allowed.

3.3 Scamming in Trades

Player-to-player trades are at your own risk.

Staff will not refund items lost due to scams unless explicitly stated in special cases.

4. Cheating & Exploits

4.1 No Hacked Clients or Mods
Using hacked clients, X-ray, kill aura, fly hacks, auto-clickers, or any unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.

4.2 Bug & Exploit Abuse
Exploiting bugs, glitches, or unintended mechanics for personal gain is not allowed. Bugs must be reported to staff.

4.3 Lag Machines & Server Abuse
Creating lag machines, entity spam, redstone clocks meant to crash or lag the server is prohibited.

5. Builds & World Rules

5.1 Inappropriate Builds
Builds that contain offensive symbols, sexual content, or hate-related imagery are not allowed.

5.2 Spawn & Protected Areas
Do not grief, exploit, or bypass protections in spawn or other protected regions.

5.3 Real-Life Threats
Any build or message that implies real-life violence or threats will result in immediate punishment.

6. Economy & Items

6.1 Duplication
Item duplication of any kind is strictly prohibited.

6.2 Abusing Economy Systems
Exploiting shop systems, crates, rewards, or plugins for unfair profit is not allowed.

6.3 Custom Items & Abilities
Abusing custom items, bending abilities, or perks beyond their intended use may result in punishment.

7. Alternate Accounts (Alts)

7.1 Alt Abuse
Using alternate accounts to bypass punishments, farm rewards, or gain unfair advantages is not allowed.

7.2 Account Responsibility
You are responsible for everything that happens on your account. Sharing accounts is discouraged.

8. Staff & Punishments

8.1 Staff Authority
Staff members have the final say in all situations. Context and intent will be considered.

8.2 Punishment Escalation
Punishments may escalate based on repeated offenses or severity.

8.3 No Public Complaints
Do not publicly complain about punishments. Appeals should be made through the proper channels (Discord or support system).

9. Rule Changes

9.1 Updates to Rules
Rules may be updated at any time. It is the player’s responsibility to stay informed.

9.2 Unlisted Situations
If a situation is not clearly covered in the rules, staff judgment will apply.

10. Final Notes

Playing on Elementrix means you agree to these rules.

"I didn’t know" is not a valid excuse.

Have fun, play fair, and enjoy the chaos — responsibly.

Thank you for being part of Elementrix!
